# ECE-493-Capstone-

This is the capstone project repo for ECE 493

## Components

### model_interface.py

This Python script defines an interface for interacting with the machine learning models used in the project. It is designed to abstract model operations such as training, prediction, and performance evaluation. The interface ensures that model interactions are consistent and easy to manage across different parts of the project.

### Random Forest.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook details the implementation, training, and evaluation of a Random Forest model. It includes comprehensive steps for data preprocessing, model configuration, training process, and evaluation metrics. The notebook is crucial for understanding the model's decision-making process and for visualizing the impact of different parameters on the model's performance.
